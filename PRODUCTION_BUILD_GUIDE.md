# Falcon Secure Chat - Production Build Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for building and deploying the Falcon Secure Chat application to the Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites
1. Flutter SDK 3.10+
2. Android Studio with Android SDK
3. Google Play Developer Account
4. Keystore file for signing the app

## App Configuration Changes

### 1. Application ID
Changed from `com.example.falcon_prototype` to `com.falcon.securechat`

### 2. App Name
Changed from "Falcon" to "Falcon Secure Chat"

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Disabled cleartext traffic (HTTP) - now only HTTPS is allowed
- Added proper backup rules to exclude sensitive data
- Enabled data extraction rules for secure transfers

### 4. Versioning
- Version Code: 1
- Version Name: 1.0

## Building for Production

### 1. Create a Keystore (if you don't have one)
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

### 2. Create key.properties file
Create `android/key.properties` with your keystore information:
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../app/upload-keystore.jks
```

### 3. Update android/app/build.gradle
Add signing configuration:
```gradle
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Build the App Bundle
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### 5. Build APK (for testing)
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Network Security
- All network traffic is encrypted (HTTPS/WSS)
- Cleartext traffic is disabled
- WebSocket connections use secure protocols

### 2. Data Protection
- Sensitive data is stored in encrypted secure storage
- Database files are not included in backups
- Authentication tokens are properly secured

### 3. VPN Integration
- VPN service runs in foreground with proper permissions
- Secure tunneling for all app traffic
- Automatic reconnection handling

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Pre-Release Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow (login/register)
- [ ] Messaging functionality (send/receive)
- [ ] VPN connectivity with messaging
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Contacts management
- [ ] Security features (biometric auth, TOTP)
- [ ] Performance under various network conditions
- [ ] Battery usage optimization
- [ ] Crash testing and error handling

### 2. Release Testing
- [ ] Install from Google Play Store
- [ ] Verify app functionality on different devices
- [ ] Test with various Android versions
- [ ] Validate all permissions work correctly
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive data leaks
